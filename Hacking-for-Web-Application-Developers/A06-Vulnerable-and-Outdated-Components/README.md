## Challenge 6.1: Inform the shop about a vulnerable library it is using
Juice Shop depends on a JavaScript library with known vulnerabilities. Check online the dependencies in the file package.json.bak.

### Tips:

1. **Tip:** Access a developer's forgotten backup file: /ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md

2. **Tip:** Look for possible dependencies related to security in the package.json.bak. Do some research on the internet for known security issues in the most suspicious application dependencies.

3. **Tip:** Use the Contact Us form to submit a feedback mentioning the vulnerable library including its exact version.
