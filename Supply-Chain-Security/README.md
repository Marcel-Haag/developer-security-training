# Supply Chain Security


As part of this training we will use [OWASP Dependency Track](https://dependency-track.org).

As you can see in the picture this tools uses [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/) as exchange format.

It is possible to automatically generate this format from all commonly used software packaging systems or programming languages like:

*  [Java/Kotlin with Gradle](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-gradle-plugin)
*  [Java/Kotlin with Maven](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin)
*  [Javascript/Typescript & Node.js](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-node-npm)
*  [C# with .NET](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-dotnet)

## Setup

### OWASP Dependency Track

For the training labs we will just use the most simplified way to install OWASP Dependency Track.

Just follow the instructions on
[Dependency Track Quickstart](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/getting-started/deploy-docker/#quickstart-docker-compose).
